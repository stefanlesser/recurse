# Games about programming
Interested in visual programming interfaces, in the last few weeks I've been looking at games in particular, which have elements of programming as part of the gameplay. I made a list of the games I found so far and thought I put that list here.

If you end up playing some of these, I'd love to hear what you think. And if you know other games that should be listed here, please let me know!
