# Functional Programming Resources

## Start Here
These are my recommended resources to start with, if you are planning to go down the same path and learn functional progamming.

* [x] [â˜… Functional Programming Basics - Whatâ€™s It All About?](https://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-01/functional-programming-basics)
    <br>"Functional Programming is progamming without assignment statements." This means data in memory is (mostly) immutable and that makes parallelism for multiple CPU cores much easier to reason about. This article is a very high-level introduction into one of the core concepts of FP and ties it to one of the main benefits. I do think there's more to it than that, but this should get you excited about it.
* [x] [â˜… Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/)
    <br>Thorough and practical introduction to functional programming concepts using JavaScript. Gets you up to speed quickly, and there's no weird syntax to get used to. A great resource to start with.
* [x] [â˜… ðŸ“º (30m) Functional programming patterns for the non-mathematician (cut)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvgwKjTPMmM)
    <br>Good introduction on how you can practically use composition, lenses, (which are built on monoids, functors, applicatives, and monads) for nesting (composition), null checking (Maybe), error handling (Either), and accumulation (reduce) in JavaScript.
* [x] [â˜… ðŸ“• PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read)
    <br>PureScript's syntax and libraries are almost identical to Haskell's, and this book is much shorter and more practical. I'd recommend learning PureScript (and Haskell) by starting with this book.
* [x] [â˜… Getting started with Haskell â€¢ Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell/1016986#1016986)
    <br>Gives you a high-level overview of what the journey of learning Haskell can look like. Several good pointers to articles and resources.
* [x] [â˜… ðŸ“• Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com)
    <br>Massive introduction into Haskell with lots of explanation and exercises. Some people find it too exhaustive, but I like this book much better than the free "Learn you a Haskell", although it's still very academic. It starts off with a very abstract introduction to lambda calculus, which I believe is an important basis to know about before diving into Haskell. It does make the first chapter a little strange â€” keep reading and don't judge the book until after chapter 2.
* [x] [Mapping the Monado](https://blog.jfo.click/mapping-the-monado/)
    <br>Pragmatic and honest introduction to monads. Also includes an excellent list of resources at the end.
* [x] [â˜… Monoids, Functors, Applicatives, and Monads: 10 Main Ideas](https://monadmadness.wordpress.com/2015/01/02/monoids-functors-applicatives-and-monads-10-main-ideas/)
    <br>Great summary of the key points on the four algebras that show up everywhere in Haskell (and are hiding in other languages as well).
* [x] [Conal Elliott - Denotational Design: From Meanings To Programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmKYiUOEo2A&t=3s)
    <br>Conal shows how he designs a simple, functional API for a graphics manipulation framework from scratch and iterates on it to make use of already available algebraic structures that maximize reusability and minimize implementation effort.
* [ ] [â˜… Haskell Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia)
    <br>Given how important it is to understand types in Haskell, this article explains the most abstract (read: used everywhere) type classes in great detail and helps form an intuitive understanding of functor, applicative, and monad.
* [ ] [â˜… Diehl: What I Wish I Knew While Learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/)
    <br>The first two secions *Basics* and *Monads* are packed with great practical tips and a solid foundation for understanding monads, an abstract concept that shows up everywhere in Haskell and functional programming.

## General
* [x] [Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs](http://worrydream.com/refs/Backus-CanProgrammingBeLiberated.pdf)
    <br>Influential article written in 1978 describing a functional system for computation which sounds a lot like what functional programming languages these days are built on.
* [x] [ðŸ“º (60m) "I See What You Mean" by Peter Alvaro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Aa4PivG0g)
    <br>Entertaining presentation about modeling state with declarative languages. Many applicable concepts although it is understandably a little heavy on the relational language this talk is about.

* [x] [Functional Programming is taking over UIs with Pure Views](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-revolution-of-pure-views-aed339db7da4)
    <br>Why functional programming helps keeping the user interface layer simple and enables hot module replacement, time-travel debugging and similar features.
* [x] [A Beginner-Friendly Tour through Functional Programming in Scala](http://degoes.net/articles/easy-monads)
    <br>Introduces benefits of functional programming by transforming a simple console program from imperative to declarative step by step. Even though it's using Scala, it helps understanding the basic building blocks of FP and their benefits.
* [x] [Destroy All Ifs â€” A Perspective from Functional Programming](http://degoes.net/articles/destroy-all-ifs)
    <br>By replacing conditionals with lambdas, we can invert control and make our code both easier to reason about and more generic. Moving conditionals from places hidden in the deepest nested function up to the caller makes intent clear and prevents mistakes.
* [ ] [Sum Types](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/sum-types)

* [x] [Learn Haskell the hard way](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Haskell-the-Hard-Way)
    <br>Just as promised in the title, an introduction to Haskell from zero to monads in a rather short article.

* [x] [ðŸ’¡ Scalable program architectures](http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/04/scalable-program-architectures.html)
    <br>Explains the core concept of composition with monoids: combine several components together of type A to generate a new component of the same type A, indistinguishable in character from its substituent parts. These abstractions scale limitlessly because they always preserve combinability, therefore we never need to layer further abstractions on top.
* [x] [ðŸ’¡ The category design pattern](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/08/the-category-design-pattern.html)
* [x] [ðŸ’¡ The functor design pattern](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/09/the-functor-design-pattern.html)
